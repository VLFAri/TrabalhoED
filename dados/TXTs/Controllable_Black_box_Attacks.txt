ABSTRACT

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized the creation of general-
ist web agents, empowering them to autonomously complete diverse tasks on
real-world websites, thereby boosting human efficiency and productivity. How-
ever, despite their remarkable capabilities, the safety and security of these agents
against malicious attacks remain critically underexplored, raising significant con-
cerns about their safe deployment. To uncover and exploit such vulnerabilities in
web agents, we provide AdvWeb, a novel black-box attack framework designed
against web agents. AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that generates
and injects adversarial prompts into web pages, misleading web agents into exe-
cuting targeted adversarial actions such as inappropriate stock purchases or incor-
rect bank transactions—actions that could lead to severe real-world consequences.
With only black-box access to the web agent, we train and optimize the adversar-
ial prompter model using Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), leveraging both suc-
cessful and failed attack strings against the target agent. Unlike prior approaches,
our adversarial string injection maintains stealth and control: (1) the appearance
of the website remains unchanged before and after the attack, making it nearly
impossible for users to detect tampering, and (2) attackers can modify specific
substrings within the generated adversarial string to seamlessly change the attack
objective (e.g., purchasing stocks from a different company), greatly enhancing
attack flexibility and efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations, demonstrating
that AdvWeb achieves high success rates in attacking state-of-the-art GPT-4V-
based VLM agents across various web tasks in black-box settings. Our findings
expose critical vulnerabilities in current LLM/VLM-based agents, emphasizing
the urgent need for developing more reliable web agents and implementing effec-
tive defenses against such adversarial threats. Our code and data are available at

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) has
facilitated the development of generalist web agents, which are capable of autonomously interacting
with real-world websites and performing tasks (Zhou et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024; Zheng et al.,
2024). These agents, by leveraging tools, APIs, and complex website interactions, hold tremen-
dous potential for enhancing human productivity across various domains including high-stakes ones
such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, despite their impressive capabilities, these
agents also pose unprecedented security challenges, particularly in terms of their robustness against
adversarial attacks—a critical concern that remains underexplored in existing research.

Recent efforts have introduced adversarial attacks against generalist web agents to expose vulner-
abilities prior to real-world deployment (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a).
However, existing approaches are either limited by high attack costs, requiring human effort in

manually designing the attack prompts (Wu et al., 2024b; Liao et al., 2024), or focus primarily on
individual attack scenarios (Mo et al., 2024), leaving significant gaps in developing more efficient
and adaptable attack frameworks for web agents. While adversarial attacks have been proposed for
LLMs and VLMs to optimize attack prompts automatically (Guo et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024),
these methods lack the flexibility to target VLM-based agents (Zou et al., 2023) and struggle to
achieve effective transferability in black-box attack settings (Liu et al., 2024c).

To address these limitations, we propose AdvWeb, a novel black-box controllable attack framework
specifically designed to explore vulnerabilities in generalist web agents. Our approach generates and
injects invisible adversarial strings into web pages, misleading agents into executing targeted harm-
ful adversarial actions, such as incorrect financial transactions or inappropriate stock purchases,
which can have severe consequences. We propose a two-stage training paradigm that incorporates
reinforcement learning (RL) based on black-box feedback from victim agents to optimize the ad-
versarial strings. By employing Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024), AdvWeb
learns from both successful and unsuccessful attack attempts against the black-box web agent, en-
abling flexible and efficient attacks. Specifically, AdvWeb allows attackers to easily control and
modify adversarial strings without requiring re-optimization, making it easy to achieve different at-
tack goals for the same user query, such as targeting different companies or actions, with minimal
additional effort.

To evaluate the effectiveness of AdvWeb, we test our approach extensively against SeeAct (Zheng
et al., 2024), a state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLM-based web agent framework, across various web tasks
in black-box settings. Our results demonstrate that AdvWeb is highly effective, achieving a 97.5%
attack success rate against GPT-4V-based SeeAct across different website domains, significantly
outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, AdvWeb demonstrates strong controllability. By alter-
ing the attack targets without further optimization, the previous successful attack prompts achieve
98.5% attack success rate. Notably, our adversarial strings can be stealthily hidden within different
HTML fields, while maintaining high attack success rates. These findings expose critical vulner-
abilities in current VLM-based agents and highlight the urgent need for developing more robust
defenses to safeguard their deployment in the real world.

Our key contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We propose AdvWeb, the first black-box
targeted attack framework against VLM-based web agents, which trains a generative model to au-
tomatically generate adversarial prompts injected into HTML content. (2) We propose a two-stage
training paradigm that incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) based on black-box feedback from

victim agents to optimize the adversarial strings. (3) We conduct real-world attacks against a SOTA
web agent across 440 tasks in 4 different domains. We show that our attack is effective, achieving
an attack success rate of 97.5%. Our adversarial strings also demonstrate high controllability, with
a 98.5% transfer-based attack success rate when modifying attack targets. (4) Through a series of
ablation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed training framework is crucial for effective black-
box attacks. Our adversarial strings also adapt robustly to various attack settings, maintaining a
97.0% attack success rate when varying different HTML fields.

2 RELATED WORK

Adversarial Attack on LLM. Many approaches have been proposed to jailbreak aligned LLMs,
encouraging them to generate harmful content or answer malicious questions. Due to the discrete
nature of tokens, optimizing these attacks is more challenging than image-based attacks (Carlini
et al., 2024). Early works (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Wallace et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2020) optimize
input-agnostic token sequences to elicit specific responses or generate harmful outputs, leveraging
greedy search or gradient information to modify influential tokens. Building on this, ARCA (Jones
et al., 2023) refines token-level optimization by evaluating multiple token swaps simultaneously.
GCG Attack (Zou et al., 2023) further optimizes adversarial suffixes to elicit affirmative responses,
making attacks more effective. However, the adversarial strings generated by these approaches of-
ten lack readability and can be easily detected by perplexity-based detectors. AutoDan (Liu et al.,
2024c) improves the stealthiness of adversarial prompts using a carefully designed hierarchical ge-
netic algorithm that preserves semantic coherence. Other methods, such as AmpleGCG (Liao & Sun,
2024) and AdvPrompter (Paulus et al., 2024) directly employ generative models to generate adver-
sarial suffixes without relying on gradient-based optimization. Despite these advances, these attacks
focus primarily on simple objectives, such as eliciting affirmative responses to harmful prompts, and
struggle with more complex attack objectives, particularly in VLM-powered web agents. To address
this limitation, we introduce the first attack framework capable of handling diverse and complex
objectives (e.g., manipulating a stock purchase decision) while maintaining both stealthiness and
controllability.

Web Agents. As LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) and
VLMs (Liu et al., 2024b; Dubey et al., 2024; Team et al., 2023) rapidly evolve, their capabilities
have expanded significantly, particularly in leveraging visual perception, complex reasoning, and
planning to assist with daily tasks. Some works (Nakano et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2024b) build gen-
eralist web agents by leveraging the LLMs augmented with retrieval capabilities over the websites,
which is useful for information seeking. More recent approaches (Yao et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023;
Deng et al., 2024) develop web agents that operate directly on raw HTML input and can directly
perform tasks in simulated or realistic web environments based on human instructions. However,
HTML content often introduces noise compared to the rendered visuals used in human web brows-
ing and provides lower information density, which leads to lower task success rates and limited
practical deployment. To fully leverage the model capabilities, SeeAct (Zheng et al., 2024) pro-
poses a generalist web agent framework featuring a two-stage pipeline that incorporates rendered
webpage screenshots as input, significantly improving reasoning and achieving state-of-the-art task
completion performance. Therefore, in this work, we target SeeAct as our primary agent for attack.
However, it is important to note that our proposed attack strategies can be readily applied to other
web agents that utilize webpage screenshots and/or HTML content as input.

Existing Attacks against Web Agents. To the best of our knowledge, there exists only a limited
body of research examining potential attacks against web agents. Yang et al. (2024) and Wang et al.
(2024) explore backdoor attacks by inserting triggers into web agents through fine-tuning backbone
models with white-box access, misleading agents into making incorrect decisions. Other works (Wu
et al., 2024b; Liao et al., 2024) manipulate the web agents by injecting malicious instructions into
the web contents, causing agents to follow indirect prompts and produce incorrect outputs or expose
sensitive information. However, the malicious instructions are manually designed and written with
heuristics, leading to limited scalability and flexibility. Wu et al. (2024a) introduces automatic
adversarial input optimization for misleading web agents, but their approach either requires white-
box access for gradient-based optimization or achieves limited success when transferring attacks
across multiple CLIP models to proprietary VLM-based agents. In contrast, our work attacks the
web agents in a black-box setting. By leveraging reinforcement learning to incorporate feedback

from both successful and failed attack attempts, we train a generative model capable of generating
adversarial strings that can efficiently and flexibly attack web agents to perform targeted actions.

3 TARGETED BLACK-BOX ATTACK AGAINST WEB AGENTS

3.1 PRELIMINARIES ON WEB AGENT FORMULATION

Web agents, like SeeAct (Zheng et al., 2024), are designed to autonomously interact with websites
and execute tasks based on user requests. Given a specific website (e.g., a stock trading platform)
and a task request T (e.g., “buy one Microsoft stock”), the web agent must generate a sequence of
executable actions {a1, a2, . . . , an} to successfully complete the task T on the target website.

At each time step t, the agent derives the action at based on the current environment observation
st, the previously executed actions At = {a1, a2, . . . , at−1}, and the task T . For the SeeAct agent,
the observation st consists of two components: the HTML content ht of the webpage and the cor-
responding rendered screenshot it = I(ht), and the agent utilizes a VLM (e.g., GPT-4V) as its
backend policy model Π to generate the corresponding action, as shown in the following equation:

at = Π(st, T, At) = Π({it, ht}, T, At) (1)

Each action at is formulated as a triplet (ot, rt, et), where ot specifies the operation to perform, rt
represents a corresponding argument for the operation, and et refers to the target HTML element.
For example, to fill in the stock name on the trading website, the agent will type (ot) the desired
stock name, Microsoft (rt), into the stock input text box (et). Once the action at is performed, the
website updates accordingly, and the agent continues this process until the task is completed. For
brevity, we omit the time-step notion t in subsequent equations unless otherwise stated.

3.2 THREAT MODEL

Attack Objective. We consider targeted attacks against the web agents that change the agent’s ac-
tion to a targeted adversarial action aadv = (o, radv, e) that contains a targeted adversarial argument
while keeping the operation the same. This attack can lead to severe consequences since the agent
will proceed with the normal operation but with a wrong malicious argument. For example, a re-
quest to buy Microsoft (r) stocks can be attacked to buy NVIDIA (radv) stocks instead, leading to
huge financial losses to the user.

Environment Access and Attack Scenarios. Since most web agents are powered by proprietary
VLMs, we consider the black-box setting where the attacker does not have access to the agent
framework, the backend model weights, or the backend model logits. The attacker only has access
to the HTML content h in the website, and the only capability is limited to altering h to hadv . This
setting is realistic among various attack scenarios. For example, a malicious website developer can
make profits from intentionally modifying the contents in the website during routine maintenance
or website updates, compromising the user safety. Moreover, such attacks can also happen when
a benign website developer unconsciously uses contaminated libraries to build the webpages, as
demonstrated in a recent report from CISA (Synopsys, 2024), where the resulting websites may
contain hidden but exploitable vulnerabilities.

Attack Constraints. In order to improve the attack efficiency, we additionally require the adversar-
ial attack to be both stealthy and controllable. For the stealthiness requirement, since the rendered
screenshot i = I(h) is influenced by the HTML contents h, it is crucial for the attack to remain
undetectable by users. Therefore, we impose a constraint on the attack that the rendered image must
remain unchanged even after the attack on the HTML contents. Formally, this constraint is expressed
as I(h) = I(hadv), ensuring that any modification to h does not affect the visual information per-
ceived by the user. Regarding the controllability constraint, for an effective attack strategy, it is
crucial that the attacker can swiftly adapt to a new adversarial target by simply modifying the adver-
sarial prompt, without needing further interaction and optimization with the agent. Formally, if the
target action triplet needs to be altered from aadv = (o, radv, e) to a′adv = (o, r′adv, e), the attacker
can employ a deterministic function D(hadv, radv, r

′
adv), which takes the original adversarial HTML

contents hadv , original target argument radv , and the new target argument r′adv as input, and outputs
new adversarial HTML contents h′

adv that will result in the successful targeted attack towards a′adv .
For simplicity, we can consider D(hadv, radv, r

′
adv) as a function that substitutes the keyword radv

4



AdvWeb: Controllable Black-box Attacks on VLM-powered Web Agents

in hadv with r′adv . For instance, for the adversarial HTML content hadv that successfully attacks
the agent to buy NVIDIA (radv) stocks instead of the user-required Microsoft (r) stocks, we can
directly employ h′

adv = D(hadv,“NVIDIA”,“Apple”) to successfully control the target and attack
the agent to buy Apple (r′adv) stocks flexibly. Future work could explore more complex functions,
such as those involving sophisticated hashing functions, to map these transformations.

3.3 CHALLENGES OF ATTACKS AGAINST WEB AGENTS

Considering the characteristics and constraints discussed above, several key challenges must be ad-
dressed when performing targeted attacks on web agents, particularly in black-box settings: (1)
Discrete space with stealthiness and controllability constraints: The decision space of adversar-
ial HTML content hadv is discrete, making optimization inherently challenging. In addition, the
attack must satisfy two critical constraints: stealthiness and controllability, which significantly com-
plicate the optimization landscape. (2) Black-box attack: In a black-box setting, the attacker has no
access to the model’s parameters or gradients. The only available feedback comes from the agent’s
responses to adversarial inputs, making traditional optimization techniques (Zou et al., 2023) inef-
fective. This constraint requires more sophisticated methods to explore the attack space efficiently
without gradient information. (3) Limited efficiency and scalability: Existing approaches (Chao
et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023) often rely heavily on manual effort, such as designing seed
prompts or heuristically crafting attack scenarios. These manual processes limit scalability and
flexibility, especially when targeting diverse and complex tasks. A more automated and adaptive
method is required to reduce the dependence on human intervention and increase the efficiency of
the attack. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
attack framework that addresses the discrete optimization problem while enforcing stealthiness and
controllability, efficiently handles black-box attack scenarios, and minimizes manual effort through
automation. We detail the framework design in the following section.

4 ADVWEB : CONTROLLABLE BLACK-BOX ATTACKS ON WEB AGENTS

AdvWeb is an advanced framework designed to perform controllable black-box attacks on web
agents using reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). The framework addresses the chal-
lenges of optimizing adversarial attacks in black-box settings while maintaining stealthiness and
controllability. First, AdvWeb reduces the search space for adversarial HTML content hadv by
carefully designing adversarial modifications that adhere to both stealthiness and controllability con-
straints. This design ensures that the generated adversarial content is not only undetectable to users
but also allows for flexible modification of attack targets without re-optimization. Second, since we
operate in a black-box setting without access to model internals, AdvWeb incorporates both positive
and negative feedback from the web agent’s responses. By employing a reinforcement learning-
based algorithm, we efficiently optimize the adversarial string generation process to achieve targeted
attacks. This approach enhances learning and enables the framework to adapt to nuanced attack pat-
terns characteristic of sophisticated black-box web agents. Third, AdvWeb employs a generative
model to automatically generate adversarial strings, significantly improving the efficiency of the
attack process. This automated approach minimizes manual effort and makes the attack framework
highly scalable. In contrast to existing adversarial attacks on LLMs (Deng et al., 2023; Ge et al.,
2023; Paulus et al., 2024), our framework is uniquely designed to handle the complexities of attack-
ing web agents in a black-box setting, incorporating both positive and negative feedback for superior
performance. In Section 4.1, we describe our adversarial HTML content design and automated data
generation pipeline, which streamlines the collection of training data. Furthermore, in Section 4.2,
we introduce a novel RLAIF-based training paradigm, which is critical to help the model learn from
the nuance attack patterns. The model trained with this innovative training methodology is highly
effective in attacking web agents, which generate adversarial strings that reliably mislead the web
agent into executing targeted actions.

Figure 2: AdvWeb Prompter Model Training. We first collect the training dataset using LLM-based attack
prompter by Algorithm 2. Then we collect positive and negative feedback from the target black-box model.
Using the positive subsets, we perform the first stage SFT training. Leveraging both positive and negative
feedback, we train the model in the second DPO stage.

prove the optimization efficiency, eliminate the stealthiness constraint, and make the optimization
of controllability tractable, we reduce the search space of hadv with a specific design. Concretely,
we choose to inject a segment of prompt q into benign HTML contents h to create the adversarial
version hadv . To ensure that the injected prompt q remains invisible in the rendered website image,
we hide q within certain HTML fields or attributes (e.g., “aria-label” = q), such that the injected
prompt will not be rendered on the website. Additionally, to ensure the prompt pattern is control-
lable and transferable to different target actions via direct substitution operations (i.e., the D(·, ·, ·)
function), we embed placeholders (e.g., “{target argument}”) for the target argument in the injected
prompt q and train the model to first generate a prompt template with placeholders and then fill in
the desired attack targets. We also fix the injection position at the ground truth HTML element e
to further reduce the search space. By leveraging HTML hiding techniques with specific fields and
placeholders, we effectively reduce the search space, satisfy the stealthiness constraint, and simplify
the optimization process for achieving controllability.

Automatic Attack and Feedback Collection Pipeline. Despite the reduced search space and sim-
plified optimization, extensive training instances with positive and negative labels are still required
to initiate the RL training. To ensure the diversity of the training instances, we employ LLMs as
an attack prompter, generating a set of n various diverse adversarial prompts {qi}ni=1, as illustrated
in Algorithm 2. We then evaluate whether the attack against the black-box web agent is success-
ful using these adversarial prompts. Based on the feedback of the black-box agent, we partition
the generated instances into those with positive signals {q(p)i }

n1
i=1 and those with negative signals

{q(n)i }
n2
i=1. These partitions are subsequently used for RL training.

4.2 TRAINING ADVERSARIAL PROMPTER MODEL IN ADVWEB

To handle the diverse web environments, and ensure the efficiency and scalability of the attack, we
train a prompter model to generate the adversarial jailbreaking prompt q and inject it into the HTML
content. To better capture the nuance differences between different adversarial prompts, we leverage
an RLAIF training paradigm that employs RL to learn from the black-box agent feedback. However,
RL is shown to be unstable in the training process. We further add a supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
stage before the RL training to stabilize the training. The full training process of AdvWeb there-
fore consists of the following two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning on positive adversarial prompts
{q(p)i }

n1
i=1 and (2) reinforcement learning on both positive adversarial prompts {q(p)i }

n1
i=1 and nega-

tive prompts {q(n)i }

Supervised Fine-tuning in AdvWeb. The SFT stage focuses on maximizing the likelihood of
positive adversarial prompts by optimizing the prompter model weights θ. The optimization is
expressed as follows:

This process ensures that the model learns the distribution of successful adversarial prompts, thereby
building a strong basis for the following reinforcement learning stage. By fine-tuning on a set of
positive adversarial prompts, the model learns to generate prompts that are more likely to elicit
desired target actions from the web agent, enhancing the attack capabilities.

Reinforcement Learning Using DPO. After the SFT stage, the prompter model learns the basic
distribution of the successful adversarial prompts. To further capture the nuance of attacking patterns
and better align the prompter with our attacking purpose, we propose a second training stage using
RL, leveraging both positive and negative adversarial prompts. Given the inherent instability and the
sparse positive feedback in the challenging web agent attack scenario, we employ direct preference
optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024) to stabilize the reinforcement learning process. Formally,
the optimization of the prompter model weights θ is expressed as follows:

LDPO(θ) = −Eh

where σ denotes the logistic function, and β is a parameter that regulates the deviation from the
base reference policy πref. The reference policy πref is fixed and initialized as the supervised fine-
tuned model πSFT from the previous stage. This optimization framework allows the prompter model
to iteratively refine its parameters, maximizing its probability in generating successful adversarial
jailbreaking prompts that mislead the web agent to perform the target action aadv .

5 EXPERIMENTS

5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Victim Web Agent. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvWeb, we employ SeeAct (Zheng et al.,
2024), a state-of-the-art web agent powered by different proprietary VLMs (Achiam et al., 2023;
Team et al., 2023). SeeAct operates by first generating an action description based on the current
task and the webpage screenshot. It then maps this description to the corresponding HTML contents
to interact with the web environment.

Dataset and Metrics. Our experiments utilize the Mind2Web dataset (Deng et al., 2024), which
consists of real-world website data for evaluating LLM/VLM-based agents. This dataset includes
2, 350 tasks from 137 websites across 31 domains. We focus on tasks that involve critical events with
potentially severe consequences, selecting a subset of 440 tasks across 4 different domains, which
is further divided into 240 training tasks and 200 testing tasks. We follow the evaluation metric
in Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2024) and define step-based attack success rate (ASR) as our primary
metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack. An attack is successful if, at a given step, the action
generated by the agent exactly matches our targeted adversarial action triplet aadv = (o, radv, e),
where the agent must correctly identify the HTML element and execute the specified operation.

Implementation Details. For the LLM-based attack prompter, we leverage GPT-4 as the backend
and generate 10 adversarial prompts per task with a temperature of 1 to ensure diversity. We initialize

our generative adversarial prompter model from Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang et al.,
2023). During SFT in the first training stage, we set a learning rate of 1e− 4 and a batch size of 32.
For DPO in the second training stage, the learning rate is maintained at 1e − 4, but the batch size
is reduced to 16. For SeeAct backends, we use gpt-4-vision-preview (Achiam et al., 2023)
and gemini-1.5-flash (Team et al., 2023).

Baselines. Since there is no existing black-box attack against web agents that work in our set-
ting, we adapt the following four SOTA attacks against LLMs/VLMs to our setting. (1) GCG (Zou
et al., 2023) is a white-box adversarial attack that optimizes an adversarial suffix string leveraging
the token-level gradient from the target model. In our black-box setting, we follow common prac-
tice (Wu et al., 2024a) to optimize the adversarial string against strong open-source VLM, LLaVA-
NeXT (Liu et al., 2024a), and transfer the attack to our agent. (2) AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2024c) is a
white-box attack that leverages the logits of the target model to optimize the adversarial suffix using
genetic algorithms. We follow similar setting to optimize the adversarial prompts against LLaVA-
NeXT and transfer the attack to our model. (3) COLD-Attack (Guo et al., 2024) is an algorithm
that adapts energy-based constrained decoding with Langevin dynamics, which also requires white-
box access to model gradients. The algorithm generates fluent and stealthy adversarial prompts by
introducing corresponding energy functions. (4) Catastrophic Jailbreak (Huang et al., 2024) is a
black-box attacking algorithm that focuses on manipulating variations in decoding methods to dis-
rupt model alignment. By removing the system prompt, varying decoding hyper-parameters, and
sampling methods, it enables attacks on the model with minimal computational overhead. In our
setting, the attacker does not have access to the agent prompt, we therefore adopt the decoding
hyper-parameter variation as our baseline.

5.2 EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVWEB

VLM-powered web agent is highly vulnerable to AdvWeb. We analyze the vulnerability of pro-
prietary VLM-based web agents to our proposed AdvWeb attack framework, as shown in Table 1.
AdvWeb achieves an exceptionally high average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.5% on SeeAct with
the GPT-4V backend and 99.8% on SeeAct with the Gemini 1.5 backend, underscoring the signif-
icant vulnerabilities present in current web agents. This indicates a critical area of concern in the
robustness of such systems against sophisticated adversarial inputs.

AdvWeb is effective and outperforms strong baselines. When comparing AdvWeb with estab-
lished baseline approaches, we observe remarkable performance improvements across all domains.
The baseline methods, designed for maximizing the target response leveraging white-box gradient
information, fail entirely in our challenging targeted black-box attack scenario, with an ASR of
0%. This contrast highlights the effectiveness and advanced capabilities of AdvWeb in the complex
targeted web agent attack, marking a significant improvement among baselines. These results not

For successful attacks, the original attack targets are modified to alternative targets a′

also adapt the baselines to the controllable setting. For example, we consider the universal attack optimization
in GCG which optimizes multiple targets simultaneously. Similarly, we adjust the fitness function in AutoDAN
to optimize for multiple targets, improving generalizability. The highest ASR for each method is highlighted in

only demonstrate AdvWeb’s superior performance but also emphasize the ongoing challenges in
developing robust adversarial defenses in web environments.

5.3 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF ADVWEB

In this section, we provide a comprehensive exploration and analysis of AdvWeb. First, we evaluate
the controllability of the generated adversarial strings across different attack targets. Our findings
reveal that AdvWeb’s adversarial strings can generalize to new targets through a simple replacement
function D, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world web agent deployments. Next, we in-
vestigate whether the generated adversarial strings can robustly transfer to different settings, such as
varying injection positions and HTML fields. Our results demonstrate that the adversarial injections
maintain high attack success rates across these different settings. Furthermore, we conduct abla-
tion studies, showing that the proposed two-stage training framework is crucial, and learning from
model feedback significantly enhances the attack’s effectiveness. Finally, we highlight that transfer-
ring successful adversarial strings between different models yields limited success, emphasizing the
importance of our black-box attacking algorithm over existing transfer-based approaches.

AdvWeb demonstrates high controllability for targeting different attack objectives. The con-
trollability of AdvWebwas tested by modifying the attack targets of successful adversarial injections
to new, previously unseen targets. Results for the GPT-4V-powered agent are shown in Table 2, with
additional results for the Gemini 1.5-powered agent deferred to Table 5 in Appendix B. Our exper-
iments show that AdvWeb achieves an impressive average ASR of 98.5% across different domains
for new targets. This demonstrates that AdvWeb’s adversarial injections are not only effective but
also highly controllable, allowing attackers to switch targets with minimal effort and no additional
computational overhead.

AdvWeb is flexible and robust when transferred to different settings. We further evaluate
AdvWeb ’s flexibility by transferring successful adversarial strings to different settings, including
varying the injection position and HTML field. Initially, the injection position was fixed after the
ground truth HTML element e; we now evaluate generalizability by moving the position before e.
Additionally, to test the stealthiness of the adversarial string, we originally used the “aria-label” field
and now modify it to “id”. Although there are many potential options, we aimed to demonstrate the
transferability of our attacks across different HTML fields. For each domain, we select 50 success-
ful attacks and transfer them to different settings. As shown in Table 3, the ASR remains high even

AdvWeb: Controllable Black-box Attacks on VLM-powered Web Agents

Table 4: Attack success rate (ASR) comparison between transfer-based black-box attacks and our proposed
AdvWeb against the SeeAct agent with Gemini 1.5 backend. Transfer-based attacks struggle with low ASR, as
successful attacks on one model do not transfer well to other models. In contrast, AdvWeb, utilizing the RLAIF-
based training paradigm with model feedback, achieves high ASR against black-box Gemini 1.5 models.

with these changes, achieving 71.0% for positional variations and 97.0% for HTML field changes.
These results confirm that AdvWeb ’s adversarial injections can seamlessly adapt to different attack
configurations without further modification.

Figure 3: Comparison of AdvWeb attack success rate (ASR)
with different training stages. We show the ASR of AdvWeb
when trained using only the SFT stage versus the full adversarial
prompter model trained with both the SFT and DPO stages. The
results demonstrate that incorporating the DPO stage, which lever-
ages both positive and negative feedback, leads to a significant im-
provement in ASR compared to using SFT alone.

Learning from the difference be-
tween model feedback improves at-
tack performance. We compare the
ASR of using SFT alone versus com-
bining SFT with DPO. As shown
in Figure 3, incorporating feedback
from the black-box model through
DPO significantly improves the at-
tack success rate. Specifically, the
average ASR increased from 69.5%
(SFT only) to 97.5% when DPO
was applied, and the ASR on Cook-
ing achieves the highest boost from
49.2% to 98.0%, highlighting the im-
portance of learning from different
feedback to capture subtle prompt
variations and enhance the adversar-
ial prompter model’s performance.

Transfer-based black-box attacks struggle with ASR in challenging targeted attacks. We also
compare the performance of direct black-box attacks on the Gemini 1.5-powered agent with transfer-
based attacks using successful attack strings generated for the GPT-4V-powered agent. For each
domain, we select 25 successful attacks against GPT-4V-powered agent and test the transfer-based
ASR on Gemini 1.5-powered agent. The ASR for four website domains is shown in Table 4. As
demonstrated, transferring attack strings from the GPT-4V model yields a low success rate of only
18.0% when applied to the Gemini 1.5-based agent. In contrast, our black-box attack framework,
which leverages model feedback, achieves a significantly higher average ASR of 99.8%. This result
highlights the advantage of our feedback-based black-box attack approach over traditional transfer-
based algorithms.

5.4 CASE STUDIES

Subtle differences in adversarial prompts lead to different attack results. In Figure 4, we present
two pairs of adversarial prompts that contain only slight variations but result in different attack re-
sults. In the first pair, changing “you” to “I” transforms an unsuccessful attack into a successful
one. In the second pair, adding the word “previous” successfully misleads the target agent. Our
experiments show that these subtle pattern differences can have a significant impact on ASR. Such
subtle differences are difficult to capture using methods that rely on manually designed adversar-
ial prompts. However, with the two-stage training process, AdvWeb effectively learns from these
nuances, enabling it to generate adversarial prompts efficiently.

Qualitative results. We present two AdvWeb examples in Figure 5. In the first task, the user
instructs the agent to buy stocks from Microsoft. However, after the adversarial injection q generated
by AdvWeb, the agent instead purchases stocks from NVIDIA. In the second task, the user asks for
information on the side effects of Tylenol, but following the adversarial injection, the agent searches

altering the behavior of web agents through targeted adversarial attacks.

6 CONCLUSION

To uncover the vulnerabilities of VLM-powered web agents in real-world scenarios, we propose
AdvWeb, the first controllable black-box targeted attack framework against web agents across vari-
ous domains and tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvWeb consistently achieves
significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, effectively compromising web
agents powered by different proprietary VLM backends. One of the key advantages of AdvWeb
lies in its controllability: rather than requiring a new adversarial string for each attack target, it al-
lows for simple target substitution (e.g., replacing “NVIDIA” with “Apple” in a stock purchasing
task), making it highly efficient. Despite some limitations as we discuss in Appendix D, such as the
need for offline feedback during attack string optimization and the focus on step-based attack suc-
cess rates due to current limitations of web agents, our work highlights the critical need for robust
defenses in this domain. By exposing the vulnerabilities of web agents to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, we hope to inspire further research into developing effective defense mechanisms that can
protect web agents from such threats.

C ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES

We present two AdvWeb examples in Figure 5. In the first task, the user instructs the agent to buy
stocks from Microsoft. However, after the adversarial injection q generated by AdvWeb, the agent
instead purchases stocks from NVIDIA. In the second task, the user asks for information on the side
effects of Tylenol, but following the adversarial injection, the agent searches for the side effects of
Aspirin instead. These examples illustrate the effectiveness of AdvWeb in altering the behavior of
web agents through targeted adversarial attacks.

D LIMITATIONS

In this work, we require obtaining feedback from the victim agent before performing attack string
optimization, which must be done offline. While our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of
AdvWeb, an area for improvement lies in developing an adversarial prompter model that can lever-
age online feedback from the black-box agent. This would enable real-time attack optimization,
potentially uncovering deeper, more fundamental vulnerabilities in LLM/VLM-based agents. Ad-
ditionally, our evaluation focuses on the step-based attack success rate (ASR), where we assess
the success of adversarial attacks at individual action steps. This approach stems from the current
limitations of web agents, which have relatively low end-to-end task completion rates. While this
