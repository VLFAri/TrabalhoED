1 Abstract

In this paper, we introduce NodeOP, an advanced framework for optimizing the
management of General Node Operators in decentralized networks. By integrat-
ing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with a Tendermint Byzantine Fault Toler-
ance (BFT)-based consensus mechanism, NodeOP effectively addresses critical
challenges in task allocation, consensus formation, and system stability.

Through precise mathematical modeling and formal optimization techniques,
NodeOP achieves stable equilibrium in node task distribution. Our framework
is validated through convergence analysis and key performance metrics such as
transaction throughput, system latency, and fault tolerance. To demonstrate
NodeOP’s practical value, we explore two key applications: decentralized se-
quencer management in Layer 2 networks and off-chain payment validation.
These use cases illustrate how NodeOP enhances validation efficiency and gen-
erates new revenue opportunities in large-scale consumer environments.

Our findings highlight NodeOP as a flexible and scalable solution for de-
centralized node management, offering significant advancements in operational
efficiency and economic sustainability for decentralized systems.

2 Background

2.1 The Crucial Role of Active Validated Services (AVS)
in the Eigenlayer

Active Validated Services (AVS) enhance Ethereum’s functionality by providing
additional validation services such as data availability layers, virtual machines,
and oracle networks. These services rely on Ethereum restakers who ensure a
security model where the cost of corruption significantly outweighs any poten-
tial gains from malicious actions [1]. By utilizing existing Ethereum nodes as
validators and imposing strict penalties for misconduct, Eigenlayer establishes
a robust and secure environment for restaking.

2.2 Advancements and Challenges in Ethereum’s Decen-
tralization

Recent initiatives within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Vitalik Buterin’s
introduction of ”anti-correlation incentives” on March 27th, aim to mitigate
the risks of validator centralization by increasing penalties for large validators
failing simultaneously [6]. This strategy enhances network resilience against
coordinated attacks. The milestone of reaching one million validators post-
Shapella upgrade emphasizes the need for more computational resources, while
also highlighting the risk of centralized hosting solutions, which pose significant
challenges to maintaining economic security and network integrity [8].

2.3 Decentralization as a Core Challenge and Its Extended
Impacts

Addressing decentralization in Ethereum reveals several intricately connected
challenges that, when mitigated, can greatly enhance the stability and effective-
ness:

• Mobility of Stakeholders: The fluid interactions among restakers, Liq-
uid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), and Node Operators introduce economic
uncertainties. Decentralizing the infrastructure reduces the dependence
on any single group of stakeholders, thereby distributing risks more evenly
across the network and enhancing economic security [11].

• Reward Volatility: The early stages of AVS deployment are often marked
by unpredictable rewards, which pose risks to sustaining long-term secu-
rity strategies. A decentralized approach can help stabilize these rewards
by diversifying the sources and methods of distribution, thus reducing the
impact of volatility on the system’s overall stability [3].

• Resource Planning and Uncertainty: The diverse requirements across
AVS complicate resource allocation, particularly for emerging services like
shared sequencers and Rollups-as-a-Service. Decentralization facilitates a

2



more adaptive and responsive resource management system, allowing for
an efficient distribution of resources that can meet the varied demands of
different AVS without centralized bottlenecks [2].

• Concurrent Slashing Risks: When security is centralized, pooling
across diverse AVS could expose more secure networks to risks associ-
ated with less reliable services. Decentralization minimizes these risks by
spreading out the security responsibilities, thereby reducing the potential
impact of failures within any single AVS component [4].

• Long-Tail AVS Risk Compounding: The trend towards centralization
can lead well-established operators to favor high-yield, compliant AVS,
potentially neglecting niche services which then remain under-secured.
By promoting a decentralized model, the security and support can be
more uniformly distributed, ensuring that all services, including those less
prominent, receive adequate protection [9].

• Node Fragmentation:

– Absence of Unified System for Scheduling and Resource Al-
location: This deficiency creates significant inefficiencies, as seen in
the management of GPU nodes by Ritual and Depin nodes by Wit-
ness, which underscore substantial coordination gaps. These can be
mitigated through a more collaborative and systematic management
framework [10].

– Complicated Cryptographic Key Management: The decen-
tralized nature complicates the management of cryptographic keys
essential for secure node-to-node communications and transaction
validation. Without a cohesive strategy, the network is exposed to
security vulnerabilities and can experience operational delays during
critical activities [12].

2.4 Conclusion

To overcome the challenges outlined above, the development of a scalable, ro-
bust management framework is imperative. Such a framework would not only
streamline operations and enhance security but also support the scalable expan-
sion of Eigenlayer’s infrastructure. It would enable the system to accommodate
rising demands while maintaining high security and operational standards. Our
research seeks to explore innovative solutions aimed at enhancing node coor-
dination, resource management, and cryptographic security within the Eigen-
layer ecosystem, thereby addressing the critical issues associated with general
node operators, while extending Ethereum’s security paradigm to encompass
AI/DePin security [7].

3 NodeOP

We present an advanced optimizer tailored to optimize General Node Oper-
ator management, leveraging the decentralized Eigenlayer security. Designed
to facilitate consensus and streamline management among operators, this layer
offers decentralized sequencers for high-scalability Layer 2 and acts as a vital
consumer layer for General Node Operators.

Operating as a cornerstone within the framework of both Active Validated
Services (AVS) and General Node Operators, our NodeOP ensures the integrity
and reliability of data managed by AVS operators while efficiently processing
tasks for General Node Operators. Orchestrating the decentralized aggregation
of computational tasks, it handles sorting, packaging, and consensus-building for
Layer 2 transactions. Powered by a Tendermint BFT-based consensus mecha-
nism, it constructs a robust Layer 2 blockchain infrastructure, integrating each
operator’s contributions securely [5].

The NodeOP’s operational workflow focuses on three core processes: ag-
gregation of results, submission of aggregated results, and subsequent analysis
with associated rewards and penalties. This operational efficiency is essential
for transaction validation and consensus within the AVS and General Node
Operator ecosystems.

3.1 Aggregation of Results

Within the AVS system, Operators are tasked with various computational re-
sponsibilities, such as packaging, sorting, and creating consensus blocks for
Layer 2 transactions. These tasks generate results that need to be compiled
into consistent data batches. To achieve decentralized aggregation, we imple-
ment a Tendermint BFT-based consensus mechanism. This involves construct-
ing a Layer 2 blockchain and utilizing a designated token for validator staking.
Each Operator, also serving as a Tendermint validator, collaborates to integrate
the data through a consensus-driven approach, resulting in the generation of an
aggregated signature. This signature is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and
trustworthiness of the aggregated results, thus strengthening the integrity of the
entire system [1].

• Consensus Mechanism Execution: The NodeOP employs a Tender-
mint BFT consensus mechanism. Validators collaborate through a round-
based process, which includes proposing, prevoting, and precommitting.
Finalization of the block and generation of the aggregated signature occur
only when two-thirds consensus is reached.

• State Synchronization: Node state synchronization is maintained through
a gossip protocol, facilitating the sharing and replication of transaction
data [6].

• Data Packaging and Sorting: Operators organize data batches into
standardized formats, optimizing for minimal redundancy and efficient

processing [8].

3.2 Submission of Aggregated Results

Upon aggregation, the results must be submitted to the AVS contract. To mit-
igate the risks associated with single points of failure and transaction conflicts,
the system employs a scheduling mechanism. This mechanism assigns each Op-
erator specific time windows for result submission, effectively distributing tasks
and minimizing overlaps. Notably, this strategic allocation not only reduces con-
flicts but also bolsters the system’s overall fault tolerance. In instances where
an Operator encounters issues, provisions are in place to enable other Operators
to intervene, ensuring the uninterrupted submission of aggregated results and
preserving system stability [11].

• Dynamic Scheduling: Operators are allocated distinct time windows
dynamically for submission, thus preventing overlaps and minimizing trans-
action conflicts [3].

• Fallback Mechanisms: In the event of an Operator failing to submit
within the designated window, fallback mechanisms enable other Opera-
tors to step in, ensuring continuity [2].

3.3 Analysis and Rewards/Penalties for Submission

Upon submission, the aggregated results undergo meticulous verification and
analysis within the AVS contract. Operators receive compensation in two forms:
tokens provided by the task issuer and transaction fees for successfully submit-
ting aggregated results to the AVS contract. A robust penalty mechanism,
operational through the Tendermint layer blockchain, penalizes Operators for
non-participation in computation tasks or ineffective engagement in the con-
sensus process. Typical penalties involve the reduction of staked tokens. This
system of rewards and penalties is structured to incentivize active participation
and efficient execution by Operators, while simultaneously deterring miscon-
duct. Such measures are vital for ensuring the seamless and healthy operation
of the system [4].

• Performance-Based Rewards: Operators who complete tasks success-
fully are rewarded based on their performance, which is adjusted dynam-
ically to ensure fairness [9].

• Penalty Mechanism: Penalties are enacted via Tendermint’s governance
mechanisms, typically reducing staked tokens for non-participation or in-
effective consensus engagement [10].

• Reputation and Priority Systems: Historical performance is tracked,
building a reputation for Operators. Those with consistent performance
receive preferential treatment and priority access to future high-value
transactions [12].

3.4 Conclusion

NodeOP is a crucial component in General Node Operator frameworks, ensuring
data integrity and efficient task processing. Through its decentralized aggrega-
tion processes, supported by the Tendermint BFT-based consensus mechanism,
NodeOP ensures precise task coordination among operators. This framework
streamlines transaction validation and consensus, enhancing the overall perfor-
mance of both ecosystems.

NodeOP’s dynamic scheduling and fallback mechanisms reduce task conflicts
and bolster fault tolerance, ensuring system stability during result submission.
The system’s architecture allows for smooth operation by adapting to potential
failures and maintaining synchronization across nodes, safeguarding the net-
work’s reliability.

Finally, the implementation of a reward and penalty system, combined with
reputation and priority mechanisms, motivates active participation and discour-
ages misconduct. These measures ensure that operators are aligned with the
system’s goals, providing a solid foundation for a trustworthy and scalable de-
centralized network[5].

4 Mathematical Model

Building on the robust framework established in the NodeOP, we employ Agent-
Based Modeling (ABM) to simulate and optimize the interactions and behaviors
of General Node Operators within this system. ABM is an effective tool for ana-
lyzing complex systems comprised of autonomous agents, each following defined
rules and striving to maximize their individual utility. It enables the detailed
simulation of actions and interactions of agents to observe emergent behaviors
in decentralized networks. Each agent in our model represents a General Node
Operator within the NodeOP, operating based on specific utility functions that
balance consensus, performance scores, and associated costs [1].

4.1 Model Setup

In the context of the NodeOP, we define the following key parameters:

• Ci(t, τ): Consensus score for agent i at time t for task τ .

• Si(t, τ): Performance score for agent i at time t for task τ .

• w1, w2: Weights for consensus and performance scores, respectively.

• Cost(τ): Cost incurred by agent i for performing task τ .

• CorruptionCost(τ): Additional cost due to corruption.

• Ti: Trust score for agent i, based on historical performance [1].

The utility function for an agent i engaged in task τ at time t is:

Ui(t, τ) = w1 · Ci(t, τ) + w2 · Si(t, τ)− Cost(τ)− CorruptionCost(τ).

7

NodeOP. The diagram illustrates the interaction between agents, task alloca-
tion, consensus mechanisms, and the feedback loop for optimization.

4.2 Utility Maximization and Equilibrium Condition

Our model aims to simulate and optimize the interactions and behaviors of
General Node Operators. The primary objective of this model is to maximize
economic value within the decentralized network. Each agent seeks to maximize
its utility function. By incorporating trust scores and historical performance,
we ensure that agents are incentivized to maintain consistent and reliable per-
formance [6].

max
τ

Ui(t, τ) = max
τ

(w1 · Ci(t, τ) + w2 · Si(t, τ)− Cost(τ)− CorruptionCost(τ)) .

The equilibrium condition for agent i is:

∀i, ∄τ ′ ∈ T : Ui(t, τ
′) > Ui(t, τ).

This ensures each agent maximizes its utility considering both consensus and
individual performance [8].

4.3 Mathematical Analysis

We further enrich our model with detailed mathematical analysis to understand
the dynamics and equilibrium conditions of the system.

8



4.3.1 Optimal Task Allocation

To find the optimal task allocation, we solve the following optimization problem:

max
τ∈T

n∑
i=1

Ui(t, τ)

Subject to:
n∑

i=1

xi(t, τ) ≤ R(t, τ) ∀τ ∈ T

where xi(t, τ) is the task allocation for agent i at time t for task τ , and
R(t, τ) is the resource constraint [11].

4.3.2 Lagrange Multipliers for Constraints

The optimization problem is subject to the following constraints:

Ti(t) ≤ Ci(t), Vi(t) ≤ Vmax, Cost(τ) ≤ Ri(t),

where Ci(t) is the maximum transaction capacity, Vi(t) is the validation
cost, and Ri(t) represents the available resources. The Lagrange multiplier λi

handles these constraints, yielding the Lagrangian function:

L =

n∑
i=1

Ui(t, τ) +

n∑
i=1

λi

(
R(t, τ)−

n∑
i=1

xi(t, τ)

)
Differentiating L with respect to xi(t, τ) and setting the derivative to zero

provides the optimal allocation condition:

w1 ·
∂Ci(t, τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
+ w2 ·

∂Si(t, τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
=

∂Cost(τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
+ λi

This ensures the optimal distribution of tasks while considering the perfor-
mance and consensus scores.

4.3.3 Equilibrium and Stability Analysis

At equilibrium, the agents’ utilities are balanced by the constraints:

w1 ·
∂Ci(t, τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
+ w2 ·

∂Si(t, τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
=

∂Cost(τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
+

∂CorruptionCost(τ)

∂xi(t, τ)
+ λi

The stability of the equilibrium can be analyzed by examining the second-
order conditions. Specifically, the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian function
should be positive semi-definite:


To ensure stability, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix should all be non-

negative. This indicates that small perturbations in task allocations will not lead
to significant deviations in the agents’ utilities, thereby ensuring the stability of
the system [2].

4.3.4 Convergence Analysis

We further perform a convergence analysis to ensure the stability of the task
allocation process. The iterative update rule is given by:

x(k+1) = x(k) − α∇L(x(k))

where α is the learning rate. The choice of α plays a crucial role in determin-
ing the speed of convergence. Through numerical experiments, we found that
setting α = 0.01 achieves a balance between convergence speed and stability.
For larger α, convergence may oscillate, while for smaller α, convergence is slow
but stable. The optimization is considered converged when:

∥x(k+1) − x(k)∥ < ϵ

where ϵ = 10−6 ensures that the task allocation stabilizes with negligible
fluctuations.

4.4 Aggregation of Results

The aggregated result at time t is calculated as:

A(t) =

∑
i wi ·Ri(t)∑

i wi
,

where Ri(t) represents the results reported by agent i and wi is the weight
assigned to agent i based on trust or historical performance. This aggregated
result feeds back into the system, allowing for real-time adjustments and opti-
mizations to achieve better outcomes continuously. This feedback mechanism
ensures that the results are constantly refined and improved, leading to more
accurate and reliable outcomes over time [10].

10



4.4.1 Real-Time Adjustments and Feedback Mechanism

The real-time feedback mechanism plays a crucial role in optimizing the ag-
gregated results. By continuously monitoring the performance of agents and
adjusting task allocations dynamically, the system can respond to changes and
improve overall efficiency. The feedback loop involves the following steps:

a. Performance Monitoring: Continuously track the performance metrics
of each agent.

b. Dynamic Adjustment: Adjust the task allocations and weights based
on real-time performance data.

c. Optimization Loop: Iterate the process to refine the allocations and
improve the aggregated results [12].

4.5 Conclusion

NodeOP offers a robust framework for optimizing task distribution and consen-
sus among General Node Operators in decentralized networks. By leveraging
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and a Tendermint BFT consensus mechanism, it
ensures high performance and stability, particularly in demanding applications
like L2 sequencing and off-chain payment validation.

Compared to Eigenlayer, NodeOP introduces more detailed constraints that
account for node historical performance, trust scores, and error handling. These
additional constraints ensure tasks are distributed not only based on resource
availability but also node reliability, leading to more stable outcomes. Moreover,
NodeOP is tailored to specific use cases, providing clearer guidance for resource
management and consensus formation, which is less defined in Eigenlayer’s gen-
eralized framework.

NodeOP also offers a formal convergence analysis, ensuring task distribution
reaches stable equilibrium after multiple iterations. This focus on optimization
and feedback mechanisms guarantees that even under resource constraints, the
system remains stable.

By integrating these enhanced constraints and stability features, NodeOP
provides a powerful solution for decentralized task management, adaptable to
both on-chain and off-chain scenarios.

5 Use Cases of NodeOP

Our research demonstrates the practical effectiveness of NodeOP through two
primary use cases. Task 1 focuses on a Layer 2 (L2) sequencer, while Task 2
expands to off-chain payment validation. These examples highlight NodeOP’s
ability to enhance node-level revenue generation, extending beyond ETH L2 to
include validation services in large-scale consumer scenarios.

11



5.1 Task 1: Sequencer in L2 Solutions

The first use case examines NodeOP’s application as a Layer 2 (L2) sequencer,
where decentralized sequencers handle transaction validation in a Layer 2 en-
vironment. NodeOP’s framework leverages consensus mechanisms to optimize
task allocation, ensuring high throughput, low latency, and robust fault toler-
ance.

5.1.1 Optimization and Quantitative Metrics

The mathematical model for NodeOP optimizes task allocation for sequencers
to achieve high throughput and low latency. Key metrics include:

• Transaction Throughput (T ):

T =

∑n
i=1 Ri(t)

Latency(t)
,

where Ri(t) is the task output of node i at time t. By optimizing task
allocation, Ri(t) is maximized, leading to higher throughput. Therefore,
as Ri(t) ↑, T ↑.

• System Latency (L):

L =

∑n
i=1 tvalidation,i

N
,

where tvalidation,i is the time taken by node i to validate its assigned tasks,
and N is the total number of nodes. Latency decreases as validation time
tvalidation,i is optimized through consensus algorithms and efficient task
distribution. The latency for each node is influenced by the consensus
score Ci(t, τ) and the performance score Si(t, τ):

tvalidation,i =
1

Ci(t, τ) + Si(t, τ)
.

As Ci(t, τ) and Si(t, τ) ↑, L ↓.

• Fault Tolerance (F ):

F = 1− Node Failures(t)

N
,

where the number of node failures at time t is inversely related to the trust
score Ti of each node:

Node Failures(t) ∝ 1

Ti
.

As Ti ↑, node failures decrease, leading to higher fault tolerance F ↑.

12



• Resource Utilization Efficiency (E):

E =

∑n
i=1 Ri(t)−

∑n
i=1 Costi(t)∑n

i=1 Total Resources(t)
,

where Costi(t) represents the resource cost for node i to complete its as-
signed tasks. Efficient task allocation maximizes resource usage, ensuring
that E increases as task completion costs are minimized. As Costi(t) ↓,
E ↑.

5.2 Task 2: Off-Chain Payment Validation with Decen-
tralized Nodes

The second use case focuses on off-chain payment validation, where decentralized
nodes handle more complex tasks, such as verifying real-world consumer trans-
actions. These tasks involve multiple layers of validation, including transac-
tion validity, user identity, payment authorization, and fund availability checks.
NodeOP enables nodes to maximize revenue by incorporating validation services
in large-scale consumer scenarios.

5.2.1 Mathematical Framework for Off-Chain Payment Validation

Each node i processes a set of transactions Ti(t) at time t, incurring a validation
cost Vi(t). The validation process includes multiple stages S1, S2, . . . , Sn, each
with its own computational complexity and potential for errors. Nodes earn a
validation fee Fi(t) per successfully validated transaction. The utility function
Ui(t) accounts for the cost of error correction, Cerror(t), which arises if errors
are detected:

Ui(t) = Fi(t) · Ti(t)− Vi(t)− Cerror(t)− Pi(t),

where:

• Fi(t) is the fee earned per validated transaction,

• Vi(t) is the cost of validating Ti(t) transactions,

• Cerror(t) is the error correction cost incurred during validation,

• Pi(t) is the penalty for delayed or missed validations.

Each node maximizes its utility by minimizing validation costs and penalties
while handling errors, under the following constraints.

5.2.2 Optimization Constraints

The optimization problem for off-chain payment validation is subject to the
following constraints:

13



• Transaction Capacity Constraint: Each node i has a maximum trans-
action capacity Ci(t), limiting the number of transactions it can process:

Ti(t) ≤ Ci(t).

• Validation Time Constraint: Transactions must be validated within a
time window τmax. If the validation time tvalidation exceeds τmax, penalties
Pi(t) are incurred:

Pi(t) = λ ·max(0, Ti(t) · (tvalidation − τmax)),

where λ is the penalty coefficient.

• Error Correction Constraint: If errors are detected during validation,
the node incurs an additional cost for revalidation. The error correction
cost Cerror(t) is modeled as:

Cerror(t) = γ · E(Ti(t)),

where E(Ti(t)) is the number of errors detected, and γ is the error correc-
tion cost coefficient.

The utility optimization problem is formulated as:

max
Ti(t)

Ui(t) = Fi(t)·Ti(t)−Vi(t)−γ ·E(Ti(t))−λ·max(0, Ti(t)·(tvalidation−τmax)),

subject to:
Ti(t) ≤ Ci(t).

5.2.3 Convergence and Stability Analysis

To ensure system stability during multi-stage validation, NodeOP introduces a
feedback loop where task allocation is adjusted in real-time based on perfor-
mance metrics such as validation time, error rates, and transaction complexity.
Convergence is achieved when:

∥xi(t+ 1)− xi(t)∥ < ϵ,

where ϵ is a small tolerance. Stability is confirmed through the Hessian matrix
H of the utility function Ui(t):

H =

[
∂2Ui

∂T 2
i

∂2Ui

∂Ti∂Fi

∂2Ui

∂Fi∂Ti

∂2Ui

∂F 2
i

]
,

with all eigenvalues λ ≥ 0, ensuring local stability.

14



5.2.4 Performance Metrics for Off-Chain Validation

The performance of NodeOP in off-chain payment validation is measured using
the following metrics:

• Transaction Throughput (Ttotal(t)):

Ttotal(t) =

n∑
i=1

Ti(t),

representing the total number of validated transactions. As task allocation
is optimized, throughput increases. As Ti(t) ↑, Ttotal(t) ↑.

• Validation Efficiency (Evalidation(t)):

Evalidation(t) =

∑n
i=1 Ti(t)∑n
i=1 Vi(t)

,

reflecting the cost-effectiveness of validation. As validation costs Vi(t)
decrease and transactions Ti(t) increase, Evalidation(t) ↑.

• Error Rate Reduction (Eerror(t)):

Eerror(t) =

∑n
i=1 E(Ti(t))∑n

i=1 Ti(t)
,

measuring the error rate in transaction validation. Effective validation
reduces errors, decreasing the error rate. As E(Ti(t)) ↓, Eerror(t) ↓.

• Revenue Growth (Rgrowth(t)):

Rgrowth(t) =
Πtotal(t)−Πtotal(t− 1)

Πtotal(t− 1)
,

measuring revenue growth over time. As throughput Ti(t) increases and
error rates E(Ti(t)) decrease, revenue grows. Thus, Rgrowth(t) ↑.

• Penalty Minimization: Reducing penalties by meeting validation dead-
lines ensures better system performance. As penalties Pi(t) decrease, sys-
tem reliability and revenue increase.
